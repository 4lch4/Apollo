# Apollo

This repository is home to Project Apollo, my (@4lch4) API for receiving events/messages from various sources and processing those messages.

For example, the first routes I added are related to cigarettes. How many I've smoked, how many in a day, etc. I'm using this to track my smoking habits and see if I can use it to help cut back/quit.
